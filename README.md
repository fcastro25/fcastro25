### Hi there

I'm Fabrício Rodrigues Castro and I studied geophysics at University of Brasília (UnB) where I graduated at the end of 2015 with a Bachelor in detect potential mineralized zones with geoelectrical techniques. I earned my Master Degree in Geology at Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) in early 2019 where I develop a Matlab suite for processing potential field data. I'm currently working as a Data Engeneer at Monte Bravo where I design ETLs in python and manage the company resources through Amazon Web Services.
